My work Portfolio meant to demonstrate my skills and abilities built with React.js.

This portfolio also serves as a show of my progress as a developer with its design.

    Some things I've learned while building this portfolio are:
        
        - Creating a slideshow preview hover effect for project images

        - React Scroll animation with the React-Animation-On-Scroll library
